      <p>A little about me, I have been in IT support for a little over 20 years. I started my career at JP Morgan Chase working in the computer stock room. After being laid off in 2002, the economy was rough and I was doing alot of contract jobs.
        I finallly got a job at Plains All American as a contractor and after 6 months was hired on full time.
        I was hired on as a Level 2 Tech. After a few years i was then a Level 3 support and then eventually I received the title of Service Desk Facilitator. I was at Plains for 10 years and then I was laid off. I then got a job working at
        Strasburger and Price which has now merged with Clark Hill. I am the main support for the Houston/Beaumont area of Texas.
